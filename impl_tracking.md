# Implementation Tracking

## 🚨 MANDATORY STANDARDIZATION PLAN - MUST FOLLOW FOR EVERY COMPONENT

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This plan MUST be followed for EVERY component without exception!**

### Required Steps (In Order):

1. **📚 Library Component (synerity-ui/projects/ui-lib)**
   - Make sure component SCSS/CSS is using CSS variables
   - Update `/synerity-ui/projects/ui-lib/src/lib/synerity-ui.scss` to include component styles
   - Update `/synerity-ui/projects/ui-lib/src/lib/synerity-ui.css` (compiled)

2. **📦 Library Publishing**
   - Publish next version of library to NPM
   - Increment version number properly

3. **📚 Documentation Integration**
   - Use that new version in "documentation" project

## Status Legend
- ✅ Complete: Fully implemented with examples
- ⚠️ Basic: Basic demo exists, needs enhancement
- ⚠️ Needs Theme: Component exists but needs theme inheritance implementation
- ❌ None: No demo implemented

## Priority Legend
- High: Essential components for basic UI
- Medium: Important but not critical
- Low: Nice to have components

## Next Steps
1. **Phase 1**: ✅ COMPLETED - All High priority components (Button ✅, Card ✅, Input ✅, Table ✅, Dialog ✅, Carousel ✅, Toast ✅, Progress Bar ✅, Checkbox ✅, Radio Button ✅, Select ✅, Tabs ✅, Textarea ✅, Tooltip ✅)
2. **Phase 2**: Complete Medium priority components (Popover, Progress Spinner, Skeleton, etc.)
3. **Phase 3**: Complete Low priority components

## Current Implementation Status
- **Completed**: 17 components (Button, Card, Input, Table, Auto Complete, Panel, Menu, Dialog, Carousel, Toast, Progress Bar, Checkbox, Radio Button, Select, Tabs, Textarea, Tooltip)
- **In Progress**: None
- **Remaining High Priority**: 0 components (All completed! 🎉)
- **Total Components**: 70+ components in library

## Implementation Plan
For each component, we need to:
1. **Theme Inheritance**: Implement theme inheritance system for SCSS and CSS
2. Add comprehensive examples to `component-data.service.ts`
3. Update `component-preview.component.html` to handle the component
4. Test the component demo page
5. Verify all variants and states work correctly

## Theme Inheritance Priority
Before creating demos, we need to:
1. **High Priority**: Implement theme inheritance for core components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
2. **Medium Priority**: Apply theme inheritance to form and layout components
3. **Low Priority**: Apply theme inheritance to utility and specialized components

## 🚨 CRITICAL: CORRECT PUBLISHING WORKFLOW - NEVER DEVIATE FROM THIS

**⚠️ MUST FOLLOW THIS EXACT PROCESS FOR EVERY COMPONENT:**

### Correct Publishing Workflow (MANDATORY):

```bash
# 1. Make changes in library source
/synerity-ui/projects/ui-lib/src/lib/[component]/
# - Make sure component SCSS/CSS is using CSS variables
# - Update /synerity-ui/projects/ui-lib/src/lib/synerity-ui.scss to include component styles

# 2. Build library (compiles SCSS + builds Angular package)
cd /Users/bhushangadekar/work/study/synerity/synerity-ui
npm run build:lib

# 3. Publish to npm (from synerity-ui directory - NEVER from dist/ui-lib)
npm run publish:lib

# 4. Update documentation to use new version
cd /Users/bhushangadekar/work/study/synerity/documentation
# Update package.json version
npm install

# 5. Create demo for that component
```

### ❌ WRONG WORKFLOW (DO NOT DO THIS):
```bash
# DON'T publish from dist/ui-lib directory
cd /synerity-ui/dist/ui-lib
npm publish  # ❌ WRONG!
```

### ✅ CORRECT WORKFLOW:
```bash
# DO publish from synerity-ui directory using the script
cd /synerity-ui
npm run publish:lib  # ✅ CORRECT!
```

### 📁 Directory Structure:
- **Source**: `/synerity-ui/projects/ui-lib/src/lib/[component]/`
- **Build Output**: `/synerity-ui/dist/ui-lib/`
- **Publish Command**: `npm run publish:lib` (from synerity-ui directory)
- **Script**: `"publish:lib": "cd dist/ui-lib && npm publish"`

### 🔄 Version Management:
- Library source: `/synerity-ui/package.json` and `/synerity-ui/projects/ui-lib/package.json`
- Build output: `/synerity-ui/dist/ui-lib/package.json` (auto-generated)
- Documentation: `/documentation/package.json` (manually updated)

### 📋 For Each Component:
1. **Library Component**: Update SCSS with CSS variables
2. **Library Publishing**: `npm run build:lib` → `npm run publish:lib`
3. **Documentation Integration**: Update version in documentation/package.json
4. **Demo Creation**: Create comprehensive demo

**NEVER PUBLISH FROM DIST/UI-LIB DIRECTORY!**
