## Status Legend
- ✅ Complete: Fully implemented with examples
- ⚠️ Basic: Basic demo exists, needs enhancement
- ⚠️ Needs Theme: Component exists but needs theme inheritance implementation
- ❌ None: No demo implemented

## Priority Legend
- High: Essential components for basic UI
- Medium: Important but not critical
- Low: Nice to have components

## Next Steps
1. **Phase 1**: Complete High priority components (Button ✅, Card, Input, Table, Dialog, Checkbox, Radio Button, Select, Tabs, Textarea, Tooltip)
2. **Phase 2**: Complete Medium priority components
3. **Phase 3**: Complete Low priority components

## Implementation Plan
For each component, we need to:
1. **Theme Inheritance**: Implement theme inheritance system for SCSS and CSS
2. Add comprehensive examples to `component-data.service.ts`
3. Update `component-preview.component.html` to handle the component
4. Test the component demo page
5. Verify all variants and states work correctly

## Theme Inheritance Priority
Before creating demos, we need to:
1. **High Priority**: Implement theme inheritance for core components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
2. **Medium Priority**: Apply theme inheritance to form and layout components
3. **Low Priority**: Apply theme inheritance to utility and specialized components

we need to follow this standardization plan:

in library: /Users/bhushangadekar/work/study/synerity/synerity-ui/projects/ui-lib
- make sure component scss/css is using css variables.
- update /Users/bhushangadekar/work/study/synerity/synerity-ui/projects/ui-lib/src/lib/synerity-ui.scss and /Users/bhushangadekar/work/study/synerity/synerity-ui/projects/ui-lib/src/lib/synerity-ui.css to refer components scss/css
- publish next version of library
- use that version in "documentation"
- create demo for that component
