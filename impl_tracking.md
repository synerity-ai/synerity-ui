- ⚠️ Basic: Basic demo exists, needs enhancement
- ⚠️ Needs Theme: Component exists but needs theme inheritance implementation
- ❌ None: No demo implemented

## Priority Legend
- High: Essential components for basic UI
- Medium: Important but not critical
- Low: Nice to have components

## Next Steps
1. **Phase 1**: ✅ COMPLETED - All High priority components (Button ✅, Card ✅, Input ✅, Table ✅, Dialog ✅, Carousel ✅, Toast ✅, Progress Bar ✅, Checkbox ✅, Radio Button ✅, Select ✅, Tabs ✅, Textarea ✅, Tooltip ✅)
2. **Phase 2**: Complete Medium priority components (Popover, Progress Spinner, Skeleton, etc.)
3. **Phase 3**: Complete Low priority components

## Current Implementation Status
- **Completed**: 17 components (Button, Card, Input, Table, Auto Complete, Panel, Menu, Dialog, Carousel, Toast, Progress Bar, Checkbox, Radio Button, Select, Tabs, Textarea, Tooltip)
- **In Progress**: None
- **Remaining High Priority**: 0 components (All completed! 🎉)
- **Total Components**: 70+ components in library

## Implementation Plan
For each component, we need to:
1. **Theme Inheritance**: Implement theme inheritance system for SCSS and CSS
2. Add comprehensive examples to `component-data.service.ts`
3. Update `component-preview.component.html` to handle the component
4. Test the component demo page
5. Verify all variants and states work correctly

## Theme Inheritance Priority
Before creating demos, we need to:
1. **High Priority**: Implement theme inheritance for core components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
2. **Medium Priority**: Apply theme inheritance to form and layout components
3. **Low Priority**: Apply theme inheritance to utility and specialized components

## 🚨 CRITICAL: CORRECT ANGULAR LIBRARY PUBLISHING WORKFLOW - NEVER DEVIATE FROM THIS

**⚠️ MUST FOLLOW THIS EXACT PROCESS FOR EVERY COMPONENT:**

### ✅ CORRECT Angular Library Publishing Workflow (MANDATORY):

```bash
# 1. Make changes in library source
/synerity-ui/projects/ui-lib/src/lib/[component]/
# - Make sure component SCSS/CSS is using CSS variables
# - Update /synerity-ui/projects/ui-lib/src/lib/synerity-ui.scss to include component styles

# 2. Build library (compiles SCSS + builds Angular package)
cd /Users/bhushangadekar/work/study/synerity/synerity-ui
npm run build:lib

# 3. Update version in BOTH package.json files
# - /synerity-ui/package.json
# - /synerity-ui/dist/ui-lib/package.json (after build)

# 4. Publish from dist/ui-lib directory (CORRECT approach)
npm run publish:lib  # This runs: cd dist/ui-lib && npm publish

# 5. Update documentation to use new version
cd /Users/bhushangadekar/work/study/synerity/documentation
# Update package.json version
npm install

# 6. Create demo for that component
```

### ❌ WRONG WORKFLOW (DO NOT DO THIS):
```bash
# DON'T publish from main directory
cd /synerity-ui
npm publish  # ❌ WRONG! This publishes the entire workspace

# DON'T add dist references to main package.json
# ❌ WRONG! Main package.json should NOT have dist entry points
```

### ✅ CORRECT WORKFLOW:
```bash
# DO publish from dist/ui-lib directory using the script
cd /synerity-ui
npm run publish:lib  # ✅ CORRECT! This runs: cd dist/ui-lib && npm publish
```

### 📁 Directory Structure:
- **Source**: `/synerity-ui/projects/ui-lib/src/lib/[component]/`
- **Build Output**: `/synerity-ui/dist/ui-lib/` (contains distributable package)
- **Publish Command**: `npm run publish:lib` (from synerity-ui directory)
- **Script**: `"publish:lib": "cd dist/ui-lib && npm publish"`

### 🔄 Version Management:
- **Main package.json**: `/synerity-ui/package.json` (version bump here)
- **Dist package.json**: `/synerity-ui/dist/ui-lib/package.json` (version bump here too)
- **Documentation**: `/documentation/package.json` (manually updated)

### 📦 Package.json Structure:
- **Main package.json**: Clean, no dist references, no entry points
- **Dist package.json**: Contains proper entry points, exports, and metadata
- **CSS Exports**: Must include in dist package.json exports:
  ```json
  "exports": {
    "./synerity-ui.css": {
      "default": "./src/lib/synerity-ui.css"
    }
  }
  ```

### 📋 For Each Component:
1. **Library Component**: Update SCSS with CSS variables
2. **Version Bump**: Update version in both main and dist package.json
3. **Library Publishing**: `npm run build:lib` → `npm run publish:lib`
4. **Documentation Integration**: Update version in documentation/package.json
5. **Demo Creation**: Create comprehensive demo

### 🎯 Key Points:
- **Publish from dist/ui-lib**: This is the standard Angular library approach
- **Dist contains distributable**: Compiled, proper entry points, metadata
- **Main package.json stays clean**: No dist references or entry points
- **CSS exports required**: For CSS imports to work in consuming apps

**ALWAYS PUBLISH FROM DIST/UI-LIB DIRECTORY USING THE SCRIPT!**

## 🏗️ MODULAR COMPONENT DATA STRUCTURE - MANDATORY APPROACH

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Component data service has been modularized for better maintainability!**

### ✅ NEW MODULAR STRUCTURE (MANDATORY):

```
documentation/src/app/services/
├── component-data.service.ts          # Clean, modular service (50 lines)
├── component-data.service.old.ts      # Original file (preserved for reference)
└── data/
    ├── index.ts                       # Main export file
    ├── foundation-components.data.ts  # Button, Card, Input, Accordion
    ├── form-components.data.ts        # Checkbox, Radio, Select, Textarea
    ├── data-components.data.ts        # Table
    ├── overlay-components.data.ts     # Dialog, Tooltip
    └── README.md                      # Documentation
```

### 📋 COMPONENT CATEGORIES:

#### **Foundation Components** (`foundation-components.data.ts`)
- Button, Card, Input, Accordion
- Basic UI building blocks
- Most commonly used components

#### **Form Components** (`form-components.data.ts`)
- Checkbox, Radio Button, Select, Textarea
- User input and form controls
- Data collection components

#### **Data Components** (`data-components.data.ts`)
- Table, Data Grid, Charts
- Data display and visualization
- Structured data presentation

#### **Overlay Components** (`overlay-components.data.ts`)
- Dialog, Tooltip, Modal, Popover
- Overlay and floating content
- Contextual information display

### 🔧 ADDING NEW COMPONENTS (MANDATORY PROCESS):

1. **Choose Category**: Select appropriate category based on component purpose
2. **Add to Data File**: Add component to corresponding `.data.ts` file
3. **Export Component**: Ensure component is exported in category file
4. **Update Index**: Import category in `data/index.ts`
5. **Add to Array**: Include in `allComponents` array in `index.ts`

### 📝 COMPONENT DATA STRUCTURE:

```typescript
{
  id: 'component-name',
  name: 'Component Name',
  category: 'Foundation|Form|Data|Overlay',
  description: 'Brief description of the component',
  examples: [
    {
      name: 'Example Name',
      code: '<sui-component>Content</sui-component>',
      description: 'What this example demonstrates',
      tsCode?: '// Optional TypeScript code'
    }
  ],
  props: [
    {
      name: 'propName',
      type: 'string|boolean|number|object',
      default: 'default-value',
      description: 'What this prop does',
      required: false
    }
  ],
  usage: 'When and how to use this component.',
  tags: ['tag1', 'tag2', 'tag3']
}
```

### 🎯 BENEFITS OF MODULAR APPROACH:

- ✅ **Maintainability**: Easier to find and update specific components
- ✅ **Performance**: Smaller bundle sizes (reduced from 1.18MB to 1.08MB)
- ✅ **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different categories
- ✅ **Organization**: Clear separation of concerns by component category
- ✅ **Scalability**: Easy to add new categories and components
- ✅ **Tree-shaking**: Better optimization for unused components

### 🚨 CRITICAL RULES:

1. **NEVER edit `component-data.service.old.ts`** - This is the original file for reference only
2. **ALWAYS add components to appropriate category files** - Don't add directly to service
3. **UPDATE index.ts** - Must import new categories and add to `allComponents` array
4. **FOLLOW the component data structure** - Use the exact format shown above
5. **ADD comprehensive examples** - Include multiple examples with code and descriptions
6. **DOCUMENT props thoroughly** - Include type, default, description, and required status

### 📚 MIGRATION COMPLETED:

- ✅ **Original service preserved**: `component-data.service.old.ts` (4000+ lines)
- ✅ **New modular service**: `component-data.service.ts` (50 lines)
- ✅ **Same API maintained**: Backward compatible, no breaking changes
- ✅ **Performance improved**: 8.5% bundle size reduction
- ✅ **Documentation added**: Comprehensive README in data directory

**ALWAYS USE THE MODULAR APPROACH FOR NEW COMPONENTS!**
